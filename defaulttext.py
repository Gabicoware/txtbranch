DEFAULT_CONVENTIONS = """You should use your judgement on how to contribute to the story. However here are some simple guidelines to help get you started.

*****
1. Pages should follow logically from their links.
*****

Readers should be interested in whats going to happen based on the link that they click. The payoff of click a link is that they will read developments related to their choice. Don't surprise the reader, unless the surprise is logical in terms of the story being told. Creating events and setting that do not follow properly from a choice disconnects the reader from the story.

===Bad Example===

  She bought an ice cream cone.

  She bought an ice cream cone from the rickety ice cream truck. As she reached forward to claim her delicious frozen prize, the ground shook. Suddenly Cthulu appeared, and she went insane, unable to grasp the depth of time and evil that he represented. Her body became ash and fell to the ground, along with the ice cream cone.

---Discussion---
In this example the purchasing of an ice cream cone leads nonsensically to the appearance of Cthulu. While it might be good for a laugh, its unlikely that a page like this will draw a reader deeper into the story.

===Good Example===

  She pulled a gun on the ice cream man.

  She pulled a gun and shoved it in the shocked face of the ice cream man. "You're going to pay for what you did to all those kids you son-of-a-bitch," she seethed between her teeth. The ice cream man's face transformed between shock, recognition, then horror, as realized what was going on.

---Discussion---

In this example the choice involved the introduction of a gun. The reader didn't know why it was introduced, or the details of how it was going to be used, but they likely understood that the story would likely take a grittier turn.

*****
2. Add Detail Incrementally
*****

Don't suddenly had a high level of specificity when its not needed. Half the point of this system is that the reader is choosing how the story should develop over time. If you want to drive a story toward a specific setting, or type of story, add these details slowly, one at a time.

===Bad Example===

  He stood up to salute his commanding officer.

  He stood up to salute his commanding officer. He was a space marine, who was sent to dangerous planets to eradicate threats to colonists. He has daddy issues, and is sleeping with one of his subordinates. Also he has a thing for cheesecake.

---Discussion---

The link indicated that there was a military focus to the story, and that the character was himself in the military. However, it also immediately established the setting (space/sci-fi), specific type of military that the character was in, and some unnecessary character development.

===Good Example===

Let's look at the same example executed differently. We'll only look at the links for the sake of brevity.

  He stood up to salute his commanding officer.
  
  He returned to the dock to board his spacecraft.
  
  He examined his well used rifle.
  
  He deleted a picture from a digizine depicting a father and son.
  
  His junior officer asked to enter his private quarters.
  
  She offered him cheescake in reconciliation.
  
---Discussion---
Here, each detail is sampled out as a choice by the reader. This is good because perhaps readers are interested in a story about a violent space marine, but not in one with daddy issues.

*****
3. Leave Your Ego at the Door
*****

It's not your story. It's not anybody's story. It's a story. You either add positively, or you don't. The author names are excluded from the pages on purpose. If you want to write a full story then write a novel. If you want to experiment and see what other people might do with your ideas, then try this out.
