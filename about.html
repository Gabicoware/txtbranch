    <h1>About</h2>
    
    <p>txtbranch is a collaborative writing environment. Like a wiki, it is meant to allow any user to contribute, propose additions, and changes. Unlike a wiki, a set of system rules is meant to organize the collaboration, bringing the best contributions to the forefront.</p>
    
    <h3>Rules</h3>
    
    <p>
        There are a few system rules to ensure some structured behavior.
        <ul>
            <li>A pages link must be less than 64 characters.</li>
            <li>A pages content must be less than 256 characters.</li>
        </ul>
    
    </p>
