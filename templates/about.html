    <h1>About</h2>
    
    <p>txtbranch is a collaborative writing environment. Like a wiki, it is meant to allow any 
    	user to contribute. Unlike a wiki, a set of system rules is meant to organize the 
    	collaboration, bringing the best contributions to the forefront.</p>
    
    <h3>How to get started</h3>
    
    <p>Click on home and open one of the trees. Select the branch that you think is best.
    	follow that until there are no more branches to open. You can then go back earlier in
    	the tree and follow a different branch.</p>
    
    <h3>Alpha</h3>
    
    <p>We're in alpha and looking for feedback! Suggest features/report issues at: (Link to be determined)</p>
    
    <h3>Application Limits</h3>
    
    <p>
        
        There are a few application limits to help ensure some structured behavior.
        
        <ul>
            <li>A branchs link must be less than 64 characters.</li>
            <li>A branchs content must be less than 256 characters.</li>
            <li>An author may submit only two branches per parent branch.</li>
        </ul>
        
        The link length is meant to ensure readability of links. 
        The content length is meant to ensure that authors aren't submitting entire novels. 
        (It's great that you want to share, but thats not what this application is for!) 
    	Two branches per author is meant to prevent gaming of the scoring system, 
    	as well as promote diversity of authors. Think these rules stink? Tell us why at: (Link to be determined)
